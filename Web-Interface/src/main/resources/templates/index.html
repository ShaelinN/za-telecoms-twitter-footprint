        note from Shaelin:
        no javascript scripting to navigate between endpoints have been added to this page yet.

        to check that the numtweets endpoint works type a URL like
        "http://localhost:8080/numtweets?company=Telkom"
        or
        "http://localhost:8080/numtweets?company=Rain"

        Note from Ntusi. I want to put a nice dark picture and change the color of h1 to white
        but I can't seem to do so, its the commented line on the css.
