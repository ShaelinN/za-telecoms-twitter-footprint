Data scraping was done using Twint 

We were able to set up a script that allowed us to scrape data 
from the four companies that we are interseted in, and also access
tweets that mention those companies.

Tweets were pulled from Telkom, MTN, Afrihost and Rain

The keywords that were used were centered around online education 
and working from home. 
"working from home ", "#WFH", "#workfromhome", "WiFi", "isp",
"university data", "data", "studying",  "university", "exams", 
"online learning", "zoom", "zero rated", "tests", "virtual",
"assessments", "reception", "mobile data", "lockdown", "telecom"
