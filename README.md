#### Database
1. Set up your local database using Neo4j Desktop
  - See the Readme.txt in the Database Queries folder to create your local database
  - The default user is 'neo4j' -> this is what the Neo4j Browser uses in displaying the database
    - So for thw Web Interface to connect to the database, we need to create another user for it
      - Open Neo4j Browser and create a new user 'java_application' with reader permission (this is the username specified in the Web Interface connection to the database)
      - Set the database password to '12345'
  
The database needs to be running for the Web Interface to connect to it

<br>

#### Web Interface
To run the Web Interface, have the database running in Neo4j Desktop, and go to the URL http://localhost:8080/
