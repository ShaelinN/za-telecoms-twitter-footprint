#### Database
1. Set up your local database using Neo4j Desktop
  - See the Readme.txt in the Database Docs folder to create your local database
  - The default user is 'neo4j' -> this is what the Neo4j Browser uses in displaying the database
    - So for thw Web Interface to connect to the database, we need to create another user for it
      - Open Neo4j Browser and create a new user with username 'java_application' and password '12345', with reader permission
        - This is the username and password specified in the Web Interface connection to the database)
  
The database needs to be running for the Web Interface to connect to it
