Our data is static, so we can know what to expect. The idea i have in
mind is to query the database, return either a visual graph or a table.
We can then explain the results in detail and assess the situation. 
We can brainstorm ideas as to why the outcome is a specific way 
and what can the company do to improve.
The Database Queries/Queries to Database folder contains some queries
that we can build on

Basic
	1. Number of tweets from a company from before and during the 
	pandemic. (Can Compare the number of tweets and whether they
	were more "active" or not)
	
	2. Top 10 most popular Hashtags used in tweets.
	Can take this idea further i.e. check the top 10 used by users
	and the top 10 used by companies and see if there is any 
	correlation. Explain why or why not

	3. Count the number of tweets aimed at a company. Compare
	the time period before and during the pandemic. (Less users
	tweeting => improvement in company services?)

	4. Top 10 most mentioned users. (From the query i've run,
	it looks like theres other companies such as Vodacom, Vumatel
	etc. Maybe we can discuss why they are being mentioned?)


Advanced

	1. Get a handful of tweets aimed at a company. Do sentiment
	analysis and display an average based on the tweets we have
	seen. How good is the rating? (Along the lines of having a
	sample population and doing some stats)

	2. Enter a users username. Get their tweets that they've
	tweeted to the companies. Display the tweets together with
	a sentiment and a comment. (How a specific user feels)

	3. We used keywords to extract data from Twitter.
	Perhaps we can filter tweets based on those keywords as well 
	and draw up some conclusion.
		Suppose we interested in "Online Learning", then 
		we filter and do some sentiment analysis?
		Filter users tweets? Filter the Companies Tweets?
		See how the users felt towards that topic
		See how the Company used their platform to 
		address the topic
