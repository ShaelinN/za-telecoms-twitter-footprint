resources package - contains the html files(views)
model package - contains java files that access the project data
controller package - contains java files that decide which page should 
			be displayed.

Single Resposibility Principle
	- Each of the html files deal with a specific query. The reults
	that are displayed are unique to that page itself.
	- They get the data that is needed and forms a view.

Open/Closed Principle

Liskov Substitution Principle
	- No subclassing is used, and hence the Liskov Substitution
	Principle is obeyed.
