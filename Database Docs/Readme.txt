Create a database
===================

(Please dont create it in the repo folder as everyone has their own local db)

In Neo4j Desktop:
1. Create a New Project then add a new Database -> Local Database.
2. Click the three dots and then click manage
3. Click on the button that says "Open Folder"
A file explorer window should open up
5. Open the "import" folder
6. Copy and paste the keyword and data csv files (from the Data folder in the repo) into this import folder

Start and open the database


Create Nodes and Relationships:
================================

Execute the queries in the following order:
(Find these queries in the Database Creational Queries folder)
(Copy the Query code one at a time and paste it in the Neo4j editor and execute)

1. Constraints
2. Company-Tweets
3. User-Tweets
4. Company Mentions
5. User Mention
6. Hashtags

Cypher queries 7 and 8 dont deal with the creation of the
database, but show some useful graphics
