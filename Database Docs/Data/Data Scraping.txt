Data scraping was done via the use of twint

We were able to set up a script that extracted tweets from 
Afrihost, Telkom, MTN and Rain. Furthermore, we were able 
to get tweets from individuals that mentioned the respective 
companies.

We filtered the tweets that we are interested in, by defining
a set of words that we are interested in. The words below deal 
with online learning, working from home and the general struggles 
experienced during Covid-19.

"working from home ", "#
WFH", "#workfromhome", "WiFi", "isp","university data", "data", 
"studying",  "university", "exams", "online learning", "zoom",
"zero rated", "tests", "virtual", "assessments""reception", 
"mobile data", "lockdown", "telecom"
